# Prediction System for Lateral Movement Based on ATT&CK Using Sysmon

## Overview
This is a powerful tool that helps organizations quickly detect and understand malicious activity within their networks. By converting Windows logs collected by Sysmon into MITRE ATT&CK techniques, security teams can quickly visualize and identify attack patterns and progress. 

## Description
